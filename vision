## ✨ Preface  

I've always believed that traveling should feel like more than just crossing borders. Every place changes us in some way, and I wanted to build something that captures that — not just through photos, but through progress, memory, and play. GlobeQuest was born from that idea: to make every journey a story, every step an achievement, and every traveler a hero of their own adventure.  

---

## 🎯 Vision  

GlobeQuest is a social travel app that turns real trips into a game.  
It combines progress tracking, achievements, and AI verification to create an honest, gamified travel experience.  
Every journey becomes part of a personal world map filled with memories, stats, and milestones.  

---

## 👥 Audience  

- Young travelers who love sharing stories and collecting experiences.  
- Digital nomads who live across countries and want to visualize their path.  
- Travel creators and bloggers who seek authenticity and community.  

---

## 💡 Problem  

Travel content is fragmented across platforms and lacks structure.  
Existing "visited countries" maps feel static and unmotivating.  
People want a way to relive their adventures, track real progress, and earn recognition—without cheating.  

---

## 🚀 Solution  

A dynamic travel ecosystem where:  
- Every visited place unlocks a part of your world map.  
- AI verifies your photos and awards experience points.  
- You level up by exploring new countries, regions, and challenges.  
- Your profile becomes a living passport and travel journal.

## 🧩 Core Features  

### 1. Interactive Map  
Each country lights up as you visit and upload verified photos.  
Progress grows by regions: Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum.  

### 2. Achievements  
Earn badges for experiences, not check-ins.  
Example:  
- **Highlander 🏔️** — reached a mountain top  
- **Gourmet 🍜** — tried 5 local dishes  
- **Stargazer 🌌** — captured the night sky  

### 3. AI Verification  
- **Tier 1:** automatic check via EXIF data (location + date).  
- **Tier 2:** computer vision validates landmarks and objects.  
- **Community:** users can confirm rare or special achievements.  

### 4. Feed & Profile  
Main screen shows your friends' trips, achievements, and highlights.  
Profile includes stats, map progress, travel timeline, and collections.  

### 5. Co-Travel Mode  
Create group journeys, invite friends, and share one story together.  
Each participant earns personal EXP based on contribution.

## 🎮 Experience System  

| Action | EXP |
|--------|-----|
| New country | +50 |
| New region/city | +20 |
| Verified photo | +10 |
| Challenge completed | +25 |
| Achievement unlocked | +100 |

Repeat visits give no EXP unless new regions or goals are reached — encouraging real exploration, not farming.

---

## 🧠 AI Integrity  

GlobeQuest uses hybrid verification:  
- **Geo-data** (location, date, camera)  
- **Visual recognition** (landmarks, nature, context)  
- **Trust score** that grows with honest activity  

This keeps the experience fair, transparent, and inspiring.  

---

## 🌎 Social & Emotional Value  

GlobeQuest is not just about where you've been — it's about what you've lived.  
The app helps you reconnect with memories, motivate new adventures, and share your world with others who understand it.  

---

## 💰 Future Monetization (post-MVP)  

- Premium analytics and map customization  
- Travel Coins for profile upgrades and map skins  
- Partner integrations (Booking, Skyscanner, travel insurance)  

*(All features will be introduced after user growth — current stage is 100% free.)*

## 🪄 Why I'm Building It  

Because travel deserves more than pins and hashtags.  
I want every journey to feel meaningful — something you can look back at, measure, and be proud of.  
GlobeQuest is a mix of memory, discovery, and play — for everyone who lives curiously.
